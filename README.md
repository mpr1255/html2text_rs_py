# html2text_rs_py
A Python library backed by Rust's [html2text](https://docs.rs/html2text) to convert HTML to plain text. The project leverages the power of Rust to ensure fast and efficient operations, while providing an easy-to-use Python interface.

Note this entire thing was done with GPT-4 and it's my first time touching Rust. I had a project where I have to convert ~400m htm/html files to txt, and I wanted to optimize that, and this public repo is just a bit of a weekend sidequest/learning experience. As a wise man once said: *"I'm in the arena trying stuff. Some will work, some won't. But always learning."*

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure you have both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Python installed on your machine.
2. Install `maturin`:

```bash
pip install maturin
```

### Building and Installing:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpr1255/html2text_rs_py.git
cd html2text_rs_py
```

2. Build and install the Python package:

```bash
maturin develop --release
```

This will compile the Rust code and link it with the Python wrapper, making the module available for Python.

## Usage

After installing, you can use the Rust functions directly in Python:

```python
from html2text_rs_py import convert_html_directory_to_text, convert_html_file_to_text_py, convert_html_files_to_text_batch_py

convert_html_directory_to_text("./input_directory", "./output_directory")

# Convert a single HTML file to text
convert_html_file_to_text_py("input_file.html", "output_file.txt")

# Convert multiple HTML files to text in a batch
input_files = ["input1.html", "input2.html"]
output_files = ["output1.txt", "output2.txt"]
convert_html_files_to_text_batch_py(input_files, output_files)
```

## Note on benchmarks

Speed was the motivation for this little project. To make sure the comparison was 1:1, I generated a ~1gb dataset of html files that do NOT contain links  (because the Rust html2text library does not expose a flag to stop generating the hyperlinked URLs, and I don't know enough Rust to figure it out). This shows that it's only ~6x faster than the normal python implementation and only ~3x faster than the Tika... Not that great... However, I will say there is a lot of boilerplate overhead with those (multithreading) whereas this wrapper has three very simple functions you can call, and the multithreading happens for free under the hood with Rust's rayon.
